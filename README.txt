Super Special Feature:
For my feature, I made the keyboard change from lowercase to uppercase
as well as the symbols changing whenever the shift key is pressed.
This required the use of Card layout for changing panels from the lowercase keyboard
to the shifted keyboard. It also made for interesting coding when lighting up the
buttons
I chose this feature because I feel like it added to the experience of having a
virtual keyboard displayed for the user. It enhances the user's participation by
responding to their inputs and showing them something that changes due to their
input.

The Five GUI Components I used:
1. Textfield for user input.
2. JComboBox for switching between the prompts.
3. JLabel for displaying instructions and number of errors missed while typing.
4. JTextArea for displaying the prompts.
5. Buttons that display for the keyboard and light up when they're pressed.
